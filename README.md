# 🌼 Flower Hangman Game

Welcome to the **Flower Hangman Game** — a fun and educational twist on the classic hangman game, where instead of losing a life, you lose a petal! Perfect for solo play or two-player mode.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### 🕹️ Solo Mode

- The player enters their name, and the game randomly selects a secret word from a built-in word bank.
- Each correct letter guessed reveals part of the word.
- Each incorrect letter removes one petal from the flower.
- The player has **up to 6 incorrect guesses** before losing the round.
- A **countdown timer** limits how much time you have to guess the word.
- If the player guesses the word in time, they earn points based on:
  - The number of incorrect guesses.
  - The time left on the timer.
- The game continues with new words until the player chooses to stop.

### 👥 Two-Player Mode

- Both players enter their names.
- The game alternates between rounds:
  - One player **sets the secret word** and **provides a clue**.
  - The other player **tries to guess the word**.
- If the guesser discovers the word, they earn points.
- If the flower loses all petals or time runs out, the word-setter earns points.
- The game switches roles between players after each round.

## ⭐ Scoring

- Points depend on performance:
  - Fewer mistakes and faster responses give higher scores.
  - In two-player mode, if the guesser fails, the word-setter automatically earns 50 points.
